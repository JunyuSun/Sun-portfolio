# Final Project Part 1
## Outline
Sneakers are very cool, and I hope to introduce everyone to the current situation of the sneaker market. A lot of sneakers have crazy prices, and I hope I can tell people about the reasons why sneakers are overpriced (e.g. consumerism and hype) through my project. Also, through this project I want to explore the relationship between performance and price which will help people have a rational consumption mindset.
## Sketches

## Data

## Method and Medium
I think I'll end up using shorthand completely for this project, and for a better experience, I might look for some copyright-free images of sneakers and some pictures of players wearing them to make the content more attractive.
