## User research and interviews

#### a. Target Audience
Since the main target group of sneaker culture is young people, and my reason for trying to talk about this topic is that I hope people can understand this culture and treat this cultural phenomenon sensibly, so my target audience is Millennial and Generation Z.

#### b. Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview 
All my interviewees were my schoolmates, and all of them are at the same age as my target audience. According to the data, males are the main group of sneaker consumers, but I also interviewed some females in order to get a different perspective. Also, sneaker culture is understood differently in different countries' cultural backgrounds and economic environments, so I interviewed students from both the United States and China.

#### c. Interview script

| Questions | Interviewee1 | Interviewee2 | Interviewee3 |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| After looking at the data, do you think you got anything out of it? | I know a bit about this market and I have collected some sneakers. You succeeded in showing the most special aspects of this market, and I think the last part about performance might be useful for my future sneaker selection. | I may not have been aware of the influence of various media on my consumer choices before. When I needed something related to sports, I probably always unconsciously chose Nike. | I don't think I ever imagined this market would get this big, and there are a lot of related sites that will go to support its development. |
| Do you think the visualizations in this presentation will help you understand the data? | Many charts could give me the information I need, but I think there are probably too few pictures of the sneakers, and some of the charts may lack contrast. | The numbers in all the plots could be bigger, I think it would work better | It's very interesting that you tried a lot of different charts, but I probably hope you can unify their styles, such as their color schemes. |
| Do you think the Call to Action part could be helpful to you? Do you want it to be any different? | I think the best part is the section on sneaker performance, which I think really gives me some better direction for future consumption, and I also hope you can provide more detailed information in the Call to Action section. | It is helpful, maybe I will try something different in the future | In my view, the phenomenon you describe may not only exist in sneakers, you can expand the scope to give a more comprehensive advice. |
| What other information would you like to get from the presentationï¼Ÿ | You can provide more data about sneaker buyers. | The story of how these brands have been developing could be very interesting, and more stories like Forrest Gump's may help this presentation. | I have a feeling that the sneakers you describe are not the type that most consumers would buy. Do you also have data on the other more popular sneakers that are available in stores? Are they somehow related to the sneakers you are describing? |
#### d. Findings from interviews
I'm glad that my presentation is informative for most people. But my perspective may still be different than someone who doesn't know the topic at all. Sometimes what I think is normal may be difficult for others to understand. I may need more in storytelling.
#### e. Changes to be implemented
I think my story may have been polished, but it still needs to be optimized. Also a lot of the visual content needs to be better modified and I need to make them look more consistent. Some of the features of Shorthand I could explore more and what I need to do is to change some of the typography.
