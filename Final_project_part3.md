## Intended audience
I interviewed three schoolmates in Part 2. At that time, I chose some young people as my target audience, considering that my topic was mainly about sneakers which is a pop culture. But as I went deeper and tried to elaborate on the story, I thought the story should be told to young consumers who have less knowledge about sneakers. Because this presentation is relatively short in time, the content can be limited, for people who are already a " sneakerhead " there is no more information that he or she can refer to. But at the same time, the intended audience is also a potential sneaker consumer group, so that my call to action will have a real impact on this group.
Two of the three people I originally interviewed belonged to this group. So, as I continue to improve my story, I take these two viewers' opinions more into account. But I also adopt some improvements that do not affect the structure of the story and are easier to achieve.
## Change from feedback
First, I unified the aesthetic design of all visualizations. I took the color scheme of the Stockx, a sneaker resell website and applied it to all the visuals, so that there would be a unity of style and the audience would feel more engaged into my story.

## Observations

## Need to be improved in future
