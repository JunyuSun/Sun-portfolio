# Sun-portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU

# About me
My name is Junyu Sun. I use he/him/his pronouns. I'm a second year MAM student(Master of Arts Management).

# What I hope to learn
Data is critical in this era, but it can also be difficult to understand. Data visualization acts as a bridge, allowing more people to understand intuitively what the data wants to tell us. Therefore, I hope that through this course, I can acquire the skills to use data visualization to make decisions in my future work, and also to convince others about my idea.
