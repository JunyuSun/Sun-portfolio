# 2. Grid of line chart
The debt-to-GDP ratio shows a government's total debt as a percentage of GDP, and the chart below shows the change in the government debt-to-GDP ratio for 47 countries from 1995 to 2019.

# 3. Column Chart
This is a column chart shows the debt-to-GDP ratio by countries from 1995 to 2019. The "waterfall" of this chart shows the number of annual changes in values.

All three visualizations use the same data sources, but bring attention to different information. The first visualization highlights how the different countries' data compare in a year, while the second visualization shows how each country's data has changed over the years. I chose the third visualization because this image shows the amount of change in the data from year to year. The size of the "waterfall" section draws attention to the amount of change in the values, not just the trend, and I chose a purple color for the columns; since some of the columns have a small area, I wanted to enhance the contrast with a background color. According to color theory, the contrast color of purple is yellow, so I chose a light yellow for the background.
